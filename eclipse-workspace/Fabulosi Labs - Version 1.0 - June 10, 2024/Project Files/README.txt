This "Fabulosi Labs - June 7, 2024" zip file contains files currently ready and
not ready for creating a half-completed simulation, in which "pedestrians" walk around
and interact with "traffic controllers" in the unfinished environment.

To open the program, execute ProgramDriver.java. When the main menu appears,
click Begin Game. You must proceed Level 1 (Tutorial) first before moving on to
Level 2 (Simulator). The tutorial should give enough instructions for Level 2.

If somehow ProgramDriver.java cannot be executed, click the link below to view
